    "## Choosing Between Xeus and Pyodide for JupyterLite\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLite supports two main Python backends: **Pyodide** and **xeus-python**. Each has its own strengths, and choosing between them depends on your project's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pyodide**: \n",
    "  - Allows users to dynamically add Python packages in the browser, providing flexibility if they need additional libraries.\n",
    "  - When users load your JupyterLite deployment for the first time, the required packages are installed via `pip` in the browser, which can lead to slightly longer initial load times.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Xeus-Python**:\n",
    "  - Packages are pre-installed, meaning users cannot `pip install` additional packages during a session. However, this setup provides a faster, more streamlined experience since dependencies are baked into the deployment.\n",
    "  - Seems to support a broader range of packages compared to Pyodide, offering better compatibility for complex projects.\n"

    "### Step 1: Install Micromamba\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage the environment and dependencies, we’ll use **Micromamba**, a lightweight package manager compatible with Conda’s ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Micromamba** \n",
    "\n",
    "(via Homebrew on macOS):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install micromamba\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "via apt on linux/WSL\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install micromamba\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialise Micromamba** for your shell (optional): This step sets up Micromamba for your shell, allowing you to use it seamlessly in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "micromamba shell init -s bash\n",
    "micromamba shell init -s zsh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Source the Shell Configuration File:** After initializing, source your relevant shell configuration file to load Micromamba.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Set Up the Build Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create the Build Environment:** With Micromamba, create a build environment defined in your build-environment.yml file. This setup will include all required dependencies for JupyterLite and the xeus-python kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "micromamba create -f build-environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activate the Environment:** Activate the build environment to install and run JupyterLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "micromamba activate build-env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Build and Run a Local Version of JupyterLite\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize JupyterLite:** Run the following command to initialize JupyterLite in your project directory. This command creates the initial setup files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter lite init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build and Serve JupyterLite Locally:** Now, build and serve JupyterLite locally\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter lite serve --contents content  # the content folder contains the notebooks that will be served.\n",
