    "# Introduction to JupyterLite and Voici\n",
    "\n",
    "**JupyterLite** and **Voici** are powerful tools for displaying data visualizations and analysis applications in a browser without the need for a dedicated server, unlike  frameworks like RShiny. These tools can be served as static sites, making it possible to host them on platforms like GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages and S3 buckets\n",
    "\n",
    "Hosting on platforms like GitHub Pages is feasible with generous usage limits (currently about 100GB/month per standard account). If your app exceeds this limit—first of all, congratulations on the high traffic!—you can optimize by using a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/) or consider hosting on services like S3 for even more scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing JupyterLite and Voici\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JupyterLite**: JupyterLite delivers a full JupyterLab interface in the browser, where users can interact with notebooks by running and editing cells. This is especially beneficial for teaching, workshops, and scientific communication, allowing users to explore data and understand analysis steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voici**: Voici is geared towards creating dashboards and visualizations where users can interact with widgets (e.g., sliders, buttons) without seeing the underlying Jupyter cells. This approach is ideal for data apps or dashboards where you want users to focus on input-output interactions without modifying the underlying code. Setting up Voici typically involves more customization, as it relies on widgets to manage user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with JupyterLite and Voici\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, the easiest approach is to use the official templates:\n",
    "- **JupyterLite Xeus-Python Template**: [JupyterLite Xeus-Python Demo](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-python-demo)\n",
    "- **Voici Template**: [Voici Demo](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voici-demo)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can click the green “Use this template” button on either demo page to create your own copy within your GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up GitHub Pages for Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For both JupyterLite and Voici, after setting up your repository, configure GitHub Pages to deploy from a GitHub Actions workflow (instead of directly from a branch):\n",
    "1. Go to `Settings -> Pages` in your GitHub repository.\n",
    "2. Under `Build and Deployment -> Source`, choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup enables automatic building and deployment via the Actions workflow, which is essential for hosting JupyterLite and Voici applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Tips: Use Firefox for Smooth Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "During development, it’s helpful to use Firefox due to its straightforward controls for managing local storage. Both JupyterLite and Voici save data (like notebooks or widget states) to the browser’s local storage to enable persistence. However, in development, this can mean that changes to your files might not show up if the cached version is loaded instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure your latest changes appear while developing:\n",
    "1. Click the **lock icon** next to the URL in Firefox.\n",
    "2. Select **Clear Cookies and Site Data** for the current site.\n",
    "\n",
    "This action clears the site’s data, ensuring you’re testing the latest version of your app without interference from the browser’s cache.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Choosing Between Xeus and Pyodide for JupyterLite\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLite supports two main Python backends: **Pyodide** and **xeus-python**. Each has its own strengths, and choosing between them depends on your project's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pyodide**: \n",
    "  - Allows users to dynamically add Python packages in the browser, providing flexibility if they need additional libraries.\n",
    "  - When users load your JupyterLite deployment for the first time, the required packages are installed via `pip` in the browser, which can lead to slightly longer initial load times.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Xeus-Python**:\n",
    "  - Packages are pre-installed, meaning users cannot `pip install` additional packages during a session. However, this setup provides a faster, more streamlined experience since dependencies are baked into the deployment.\n",
    "  - Seems to support a broader range of packages compared to Pyodide, offering better compatibility for complex projects.\n",

    "### Step 1: Install Micromamba\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage the environment and dependencies, we’ll use **Micromamba**, a lightweight package manager compatible with Conda’s ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Micromamba** \n",
    "\n",
    "(via Homebrew on macOS):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install micromamba\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "via apt on linux/WSL\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt install micromamba\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialise Micromamba** for your shell (optional): This step sets up Micromamba for your shell, allowing you to use it seamlessly in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "micromamba shell init -s bash\n",
    "micromamba shell init -s zsh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Source the Shell Configuration File:** After initializing, source your relevant shell configuration file to load Micromamba.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Set Up the Build Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create the Build Environment:** With Micromamba, create a build environment defined in your build-environment.yml file. This setup will include all required dependencies for JupyterLite and the xeus-python kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "micromamba create -f build-environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activate the Environment:** Activate the build environment to install and run JupyterLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "micromamba activate build-env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Build and Run a Local Version of JupyterLite\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize JupyterLite:** Run the following command to initialize JupyterLite in your project directory. This command creates the initial setup files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter lite init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build and Serve JupyterLite Locally:** Now, build and serve JupyterLite locally\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter lite serve --contents content  # the content folder contains the notebooks that will be served.\n",
    "```\n"
